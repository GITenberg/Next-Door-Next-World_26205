</div><p class="firstp"><span class="dcap">ungrily</span>, the cradled
vessel's great steel nose
pointed up to the distant
stars. She was the
<i>Cosmos XII</i>, newest
and sleekest of the Space Service's
rapidly-expanding wing of interstellar
scout ships, and she was now
ready for operational work.</p>

<p>Major Lance Cooper, a big man
with space-tanned features, stood in
the shadow of the control bunker
and watched the swarm of ground
crewmen working at last-minute
speed atop the loading tower. Inside
him burned a hunger, too.</p>

<p>Hunger, and another emotion&mdash;pride.</p>

<p>The pride swelled Lance's open-collared
khaki shirt, as he envisioned
himself at the ship's controls within
a few minutes. Finally, after long
years of study, sweat and dedication,
he'd made it to the Big League. No
more jockeying those tubby old rocket-pots
to Luna! From here on, he
was going to see, taste, feel what the
universe was like way, way out&mdash;in
Deep Space. The <i>Cosmos XII</i>, like
her earlier sisters, was designed to
plow through that shuddery nowhere
the cookbooks identified as "hyperspace."</p>

<p>Lance's glance shifted upward,
scanning the velvet backdrop of
frosty white points of light against
which the slender, silverish, almost
wingless form stood framed. More
stars than a man could visit in a lifetime!
And some already within
grasp!</p>

<p>His exultant feeling grew, and
Lance kept his head tilted backward.
Alpha Centauri, the most popular
target, was not visible at this latitude;
and Barnard's star, besides being far
too faint, lay on the other side of the
sun. But there shone Sirius, just as
bright as it had glittered for the
Greeks, and frosty Procyon, a little to
the north. Both orbs twinkled and
beckoned, evoking strange and demanding
dreams!</p>

<p>One day, Man would be able to
make landings. Teams of scientists
outfitted to the eyebrows and trained
to cope with any environment or
emergency, would explore unknown
jungles, <i>llanos</i>, steppes; tramp up
and down fertile vales and hills under
blue-hot alien suns. Perhaps, they
might even contact native species
boasting human intelligence: mammalian
hunters and fishers, city-building
lizards, sky-probing arachnids&mdash;who
knew what?</p>

<p>But now, of course, all that Headquarters
permitted of flights was the
most furtive of reconnoitering. You
hoisted your scout ship aloft under
high-gee, cleared the ecliptic, then
swung out of normal space and
<i>jumped</i>. When you materialized in
the new sector, you set your cameras
clicking, toggled all the other instruments
into recording radiation, gravity
pressures, spectroscopy, at slam-bang
speed. The very instant your
magnetic tapes got crammed to capacity,
you pressed six dozen panic
buttons and scooted like a scared
jackrabbit for Home, Sweet Home.</p>

<p>Adventure? It wasn't even mentioned
on the travel posters, yet.</p>

<p>But, adventure would follow.</p>

<p>Some day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the taxpayers' expense,
you&mdash;the guardian of the
Peace&mdash;had enjoyed the billion-dollar
thrill of viewing our Solar System
from light-years and light-years of
distance. Or so the manual said, right
here on Insert Page 30-Dash-11-Dash-6.</p>

<p>Lance thought about those veteran
hype-pilots who'd already poked
around in the great black Cold out
there. How was it they were always
compensating for their frustration?</p>

<p>Now, he remembered.</p>

<p>Having few tall tales to spellbind
audiences with when they swooped
back down on Home Base after their
missions, the hype-pilots got around
it by bragging up Terra itself, and
how at least you could always depend
upon good old Earth to come up
with something to relax this Warp-Weary
generation!</p>

<p>"Something, for example, such as
we now hold in our hand, brothers!"
Lance could hear them now. "Namely,
one of these superbly-programmed
cocktails, as only Casey can turn out."</p>

<p>(Casey was the Officers Club barkeep
and much-beribboned mixologist.)</p>

<p>"A real 'Casey Special'&mdash;look at its
pristine beauty! What better consolation
can a man ask, for not having
gotten to land at the apogee point of
his orbit?"</p>

<p>"Besides"&mdash;this usually came out
after two or three more tongue-loosening
toasts had been quaffed to the
beasts of Headquarters&mdash;"what's so
blasted special about landing on some
God-forsaken rock <i>out there</i>?</p>

<p>"Hell's bells! Earth is a planet too,
isn't it? And when you've been
cooped up in a parsec-gobbling pot
for a very, very long two weeks, any
planet looming in your viewscope
cries to be set down upon. Your own
prosaic hunk of mud is good as any!"</p>

<hr />

<p>Lance Cooper's rambling thoughts
broke off their aimless tracking to
swing one hundred and eighty degrees
in midspace and dart right
back to Earth.</p>

<p>Here at this very moment&mdash;and
less than a hundred yards away&mdash;came
Terra's foremost attraction for
him. His hammering heartbeat
would have placed him on the
"grounded" list immediately, had
there been a medico with a stethoscope
hanging about to detect it.</p>

<p>The attraction's name was Carolyn
Sagen, and she was hurrying directly
across the concrete apron.</p>

<p>Even under the incandescent
work-lamps of the crew scrambling
up and down the ladders, she looked
as fetching as a video starlet making
her first personal-appearance tour of
the nation. Only the fact she was
Colonel "Hard-Head" Sagen's family
pride and joy kept the helmeted and
half-puckered up techs on the rungs
from whistling themselves dry in
their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Now, she had completely bypassed
the work area. Here, the lighting
did not reach and the paler illumination
of starshine took over. It
seemed to render the girl's soft blond
hair and her full warm lips more intimately
something belonging to
Lance Cooper alone&mdash;and he liked
that. He saw that she had turned up
the collar of her tan coat against the
night wind.</p>

<p>While still a step or two distant
from him, Carolyn halted. Her worshiping
eyes rested fully upon the
big pilot. Lance thought he detected
a troubled expression.</p>

<p>Then, the girl managed a tight
smile that conveyed her outward resignment
to all Man's absurd aspirations
to own the galaxy:</p>

<p>"Don't worry about 'Security,'
Lance. Dad wrote me out an O.K. to
skitter up this close to the Launching
Area. You know"&mdash;she gestured self-consciously&mdash;"big
crucial moment ... lovers'
farewell ... I pulled
all the stops, but it worked."</p>

<p>"Matter of fact," she added, in an
obvious attempt at facetiousness,
"Dad opined he'd have walloped the
daylights out of me, if I hadn't put
up a struggle to get near my man."</p>

<p>Then suddenly, she was not at all
brave, anymore.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she had burrowed into
his arms. "Oh Lance, had there been
no other way, I'd have clawed right
through fence and revetments to get
to you! Men, men! Just because
something's <i>out there</i>, as you say ... why
is it so important to build
ships and go out and look at it?"
Her fingers dug into Lance's shoulders.
"Women are saner ... but
maybe that's why men need us." The
grip of her fingers shifted, tightened.
"Kiss me, you big baboon."</p>

<p>Lance kissed her. A tender kiss, yet
gusty enough that he lifted her from
the ground and her high-heeled shoes
kicked in free fall.</p>

<p>The pilot found his girl's breath
warm, loving. Yet her cheeks
seemed colder than even the crisp
air should account for. And her body
was trembling.</p>

<p>He planted a second kiss, then set
her down.</p>

<p>"Hey! This is no way for a Space
Service brat to carry on. Why, you're
just about to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To cry, Lance? No, I wasn't.
It's just that ... you'll be gone so
long."</p>

<p>He punched her playfully. "Two
measly weeks out, two weeks to astrogate
her back home. And once I've
got my feet wet at it, it'll be like
shooting ducks in an alley."</p>

<p>Carolyn reached out, brushed a
windswept tuft of hair from above
the rock-steady eyes that looked at
her.</p>

<p>"I know, Lance. I even realize that
just ten years ago, women had to put
up with separations from their sweethearts
or husbands that lasted months.
When the old pioneer ships used to
limp back and forth to Mars and
Venus. But I'm different, I guess.
Weak, maybe. Or just plain scared&mdash;"</p>

<p>This didn't sound like the blithe-spirited
girl he'd pursued for a year,
then wooed and subdued. Lance studied
her, then said slowly: "You're
scared. About what? My first flight?"</p>

<p>Carolyn's head bobbed timidly.</p>

<p>Lance flashed a reassuring grin.
"Everything has to be a brand-new
experience, at some time or other.
Me, I prefer to look at hype-flight
from the point of view of the service.
A routine thing. Just takes training.
Otherwise," and he shrugged, "it's no
more a risk than hauling groceries
upstairs to some weather satellite."</p>

<p>"Is it, Lance? When one or two
ships out of every ten never make it
back at all. Just disappear ... somewhere
... while the others&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One out of thirty or forty, you
mean. So hyperspace is a little
tricky."</p>

<p>"And there's always pilot error to
blame, too, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Now that you mention it."</p>

<p>"Only my man is immune from
everything?"</p>

<p>Lance smiled, a little wryly. "Any
pilot can make boo-boos, Carolyn.
I'm determined to try awfully hard
not to." He added a slight qualification
to his statement. "I've always
been pretty lucky up to now, at not
getting lost."</p>

<p>"I thought the guidance systems
and the autopilot computers took
care of all the astrogation corrections?"</p>

<p>"On a theoretically perfect flight,
yes. It's equally true, however, that
hyperspace's geometry doesn't always
resemble the sort of lines and angles
you find in our own universe&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p>Lance abruptly stopped, realizing
he was quoting text; his mind groped
for a better way to explain. But Carolyn
plunged in first:</p>

<p>"You see, there do sometimes develop
special situations."</p>

<p>"Sure, sometimes." An exasperation
crept into Lance Cooper's voice,
despite his effort to keep it out. Hell,
he was just a pilot; not a rated mathematician.
He'd fly hyperspace by the
seat of his pants, if he had to.</p>

<p>"Lance," said Carolyn.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You feel it too, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Feel what?"</p>

<p>"That there is danger involved.
That something dreadfully, dreadfully
wrong <i>can</i> happen to you while
you're out there. No matter what the
eggheads say about it." A paroxysm of
sobs suddenly racked the girl's slender
body. "Oh, darling, don't go!"</p>

<p>"Honey, honey!" Lance patted her
thin shoulders.</p>

<p>"I love you so much."</p>

<p>"Love you, too, Carolyn. You know
that."</p>

<p>"We shouldn't have postponed the
wedding. It was wrong to set the date
back."</p>

<p>Lance shook his head. "Sorry. I
couldn't see it any other way."</p>

<p>He hugged the girl to him; she
seemed more desperately frightened
than he had realized. And again, as
always when it came to comforting
somebody, he felt as awkward and
clumsy as some big lumbering repair-tug
out in space&mdash;say&mdash;trying to
patch a small trim patrol craft.</p>

<p>But especially, he felt helpless in
the presence of this frail, clinging,
lovely piece of femininity he wanted
so dearly. Nevertheless he could keep
on trying&mdash;blundering though his
words and gestures might be.</p>

<p>"Carolyn, you think I wanted to
chance making you a widow twenty-four
hours after you became a bride?"
Lance took a deep breath. "So I did
maintain the percentage wasn't great.
Still, it does exist. I'm aware of that.
I just don't let it concern me. But
you, Carolyn&mdash;don't you see, hon?
Lance Cooper couldn't let anything
bad happen to his best girl."</p>

<p>"I'm trying to understand," said
Carolyn.</p>

<p>Lance's blunt, serious face peered
into hers. "Tell you what I will promise
to do."</p>

<p>Hope cleared away some of the
mistiness in Carolyn's eyes. She
looked up at him. "What, Lance?"</p>

<p>"Once I've knocked off my shell-back
trip through the hype, we'll stage
the fanciest wedding this old space
base ever goggled its eyes over. I'll
even see to it, the chaplain samples the
spiked punch. And you remember
what a raconteur the padre proved to
be when Light-Colonel Galache got
spliced?"</p>

<p>Carolyn Sagen managed a wan
smile.</p>

<p>Lance revved his pep-talk up a
few hundred r.p.m. "After all, think
of it this way. Suppose I hadn't beat
my brains out to get into hype-training?
I'd never have wound up at this
base. You and me would never have
met. I'd never have fallen for you
like a ton of space-ballast."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you're right," said
Carolyn, clinging more tightly than
ever to Lance's solid frame. "You're
always right, just like the Space Service
is always right. But I have a woman's
intuition. And I ... I sense&mdash;"</p>

<p>Unable to finish, she released her
grasp and once more withdrew into
herself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lance's big muscular hand reached
out, tilted the girl's chin upward. Her
face was tear-stained for sure, now.</p>

<p>"Honey, this won't ever do."</p>

<p>"I can't help it."</p>

<p>"You're torturing yourself with
useless premonitions." Lance wiped
the briny shine from the girl's cheeks
as he talked, his own voice getting
hoarser. "Carolyn, I love you so much
that I ... well, you know I happen
to hunger for you more than I do that
Christmas tree on my control deck.
But I just couldn't give up a chance
to solo out to the stars. I couldn't,
baby. I'd probably be court-martialed,
anyhow," he added.</p>

<p>"No, Lance. They wouldn't do
that. Not unless you actually got into
space, then turned back. I asked Major
Carmody."</p>

<p>"Carolyn! You didn't?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded, affirming the
truth of what she said. "Lance, I had
to. T-there are some things I know
about that you don't." A note of sudden
urgency now tinged her voice.
"Strange unfathomable things. Many
of the other pilots who've come back
have not been right. I think it has
something to do with their having
been outside of normal space&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stared at her. "I just now realize
you're trying to tell me something."</p>

<p>"Lance, I happened to overhear
Dad telling Mother something one
night. Apparently, he'd been rolling
and tossing in bed, couldn't sleep.
And Mother's looked after him so
long, she just had to know what was
wrong. They went downstairs and
she poured him a stiff drink. Then in
return, Dad poured out his troubled
soul to her. And Lance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Carolyn?"</p>

<p>"The most probable reason why
some hype-pilots never quite make it
back to our world is that the men
involved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The men? You mean, the pilots?"</p>

<p>"No, the brass. They haven't told
the pilots about the fissioning of anything
that gets into hyperspace&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carolyn's breath gave out in a
sudden gasp. Her eyes moved away
alarmed, and Lance's own glance
turned simultaneously. He saw Colonel
"Hard-Head" Sagen and two
other officers coming across the area.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/003.png" width="600" height="462" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Time had run out on them.</p>

<p>"Carolyn," Lance said, hurriedly.
"I've gabbed with quite a few vets of
hyperspace. At the Club and in my
training, both. Sure, a man feels like
he's been crammed into a concrete
mixer when he's burning up light-years
in a hyper ship. But after a
while, I'm told, even your brains get
used to being bounced around."
Lance took the girl's hands and
squeezed them between his. "So let's
not worry, huh?"</p>

<p>Carolyn started to say something
in rebuttal, but her father and his
aides were already upon them.</p>

<p>Colonel Sagen was a tall thin man
of erect military carriage. His features
were crisscrossed with radiation
scars and his voice boomed out like a
military drum. Yet when one got to
know him, he wasn't so gruff. On the
base, he commanded two thousand
military personnel and half that
many scientists and techs: a tough
job, and one that he was giving his
best.</p>

<p>After returning Major Lance
Cooper's brisk salute, the colonel unbent
and gave his prospective son-in-law
a hardy handshake.</p>

<p>"Lance, I hope you'll be able to
keep more of a rein on this little
space-filly of mine, than I've been
able to. She was determined to see
you off."</p>

<p>"I was glad to see her, colonel."</p>

<p>The colonel smiled. "Can't think
of a man on this base I'd rather turn
Carolyn over to."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Lance.</p>

<p>"Been counting the minutes to
take-off, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"He's hardly had a chance to, Dad,"
Carolyn broke in. "What with me in
his hair!"</p>

<p>One of the colonel's aides glanced
at his watch, then opened up a brief
case and took out a sealed envelope.
The colonel relieved him of it and
handed it to Lance.</p>

<p>"Your flight orders, Lance. Got the
preset tapes installed and checked?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, you should know your onions
now, if you're ever going to. Best
of luck, son."</p>

<p>"Thank you, colonel."</p>

<p>Lance turned. "Good-by, Carolyn.
Just four weeks now, like I said."</p>

<p>"I'll be waiting."</p>

<p>"First jump's always the hardest, I
hear," spoke up the second aide,
cheerily. Like a great many other execs,
the officer boasted no active space
rating, though he did wear the winged
moons of an observer.</p>

<p>But Lance and Carolyn were again
quite busy, and did not hear.</p>

<hr />

<p>Inside the shell of the <i>Cosmos XII</i>,
Lance, sitting flat on his back against
gravity, looked up at the sweep hands
on the control deck clocks and hurried
through his pre-jump check list.
Tension mounted inside him. He contacted
the Operations people in the
bunker over the radio net. Colonel
Sagen's voice came in clear: "Five
minutes, Lance."</p>

<p>"I am receiving. Area cleared?"</p>

<p>Traffic broke into report: "Take-off
will proceed on schedule."</p>

<p>The function lights on the "tree"
in front of Lance shone green. Gyros
were caged; the tapes were set to roll.
Lance's big hands hovered lightly
near the manual over-rides. He was
ready to fly, and the autopilot lights
were already winking out in count-down.
But you never could be sure
until the last moment.</p>

<p>What had Carolyn been trying to
tell him?</p>

<p>Before he could pursue the
thought, he felt the pressure of the
rising ship take hold; gently at first
as she cleared the ground; then heavier
and heavier, until his face felt like
a rubber mask under the acceleration
and his heart commenced pounding.</p>

<p>It didn't take long these days for
any ship to build up a tremendous
velocity in space. Lance cleared the
ecliptic by a hundred million miles;
then with the Solar System spread out
flat below him, he opened up his
flight orders. His destination, he discovered,
was Groombridge 34, a visual double star.
Right ascension: zero
hours, thirteen minutes. Declination:
forty-three and four-tenths degrees.
Nearly twelve light-years distant.</p>

<p>Since the star's apparent location
was nearly halfway up the sky from
the celestial equator, Lance could begin
the jump any time and not worry
on his way about skewing too near
the gravitational field of any large-massed
body in his own immediate
vicinity.</p>

<p>He permitted himself one brief
glance at the blazing universe that
hung all about him: the bright fixed
lights that were innumerable suns
against an eternal blackness, and the
luminous dust in between that was
even farther-flung. Confusion and
chaos seemed to dwell here; if a man
gazed too long, he could quietly go
mad. But even more insane, he anticipated,
would be the thick, writhing
nothingness of hyperspace.</p>

<p>Lance Cooper made one final
check of all the ship's operating components;
then crossed his fingers and
cut in the hype-drive.</p>

<p>Instantly, his teeth crashed together
and clenched; his strapped-in body
was jerked back in its cushioned seat;
sweat beaded his brow. A thousand
needles prickling his skin couldn't
have been worse. He had been told
once that the switching-out from this
known universe into an unknown
one would feel just like a ten-thousand
volt jolt in an old-fashioned
electric chair; and now he could believe
it. Every cell in his body had begun
tingling; his stomach pitched
under a racking nausea; and an involuntary
trickle of saliva dripped
from his mouth the moment he got
his jaws working again.</p>

<p>But Lance fought the nausea,
fought the sickness, and gradually as
his flesh accommodated to the
change, he felt better.</p>

<p>It was then that the most disturbing
phenomenon of all took place.
He felt for a moment as if he had
been split into two persons. No, four
persons, eight, sixteen, an infinity of
other selves. They were all beside
him, in him and out of him. His eyes
ached. He shut them.</p>

<p>When he opened them again, everything
was almost back to normal.
The other selves had vanished. Only
the constant throbbing vibration of
the ship remained; yet it was a discomfort
that had to be endured for
four solid straight weeks now. There
was no other means known, by which
a man-made vessel could travel faster
than light.</p>

<p>Funny about that four weeks, too,
thought Lance. All distances in hyperspace
were the same, no matter
where you wished to go; it required
no more than fourteen days and no
less, regardless of whether you
jumped one light-year or fifty. Lance
had always understood there were
equations on file at HQ, which explained
the paradox. But not being a
math expert, he had never missed not
being allowed to see them.</p>

<p>He flicked a switch and opened up
his viewports again. The starry universe
had vanished. The <i>Cosmos XII</i>
was riding through a gray void.
Alone and&mdash;</p>

<p>No, it wasn't alone!</p>

<p>Again, Lance's vision suffered a
wrenching sickness. Out there in the
colorless vacuum, hundreds of replicas
of the <i>Cosmos XII</i> rode along beside
him, above him, below him,
stretched out in all directions.</p>

<p>There had been nothing in the
manuals about this.</p>

<p>Lance stared at the meaningless
phenomenon for a long time despite
the fact it made his brain ill. At last,
he decided it was harmless, whatever
was causing it. He shook his head
slowly and closed the ports down. He
hoped Groombridge 34 would be less
taxing.</p>

<hr />

<p>The system was.</p>

<p>After the ship reverted to normal
space in the vicinity of Groombridge
34, Lance hovered about it exactly
twelve hours, following all the instructions
in his manual to the letter.
He started up the cameras and other
recording instruments. All went well,
there were no incidents, no vessels
disturbed him; though had the two
components of the binary been at
periastron, it would have simplified
the work with the position micrometer.
If anything else of interest had
been detected, it would have to be
deciphered from the film and tapes
later. You can get as close as four billion
miles to an Earth-sized planet in
space&mdash;and it'll still show up fainter
than a fourteenth magnitude star.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the galaxy, Lance
supposed, there must be other races
building spaceships and guiding
them from sun to sun. But thus far,
the scout ships from Terra&mdash;for all
their magnified caution&mdash;had never
run into signs of any.</p>

<p>The old veteran hype-pilots had
the best philosophy after all. Earth
was the choicest hunk of mud you
were going to find. <i>Enjoy it, brethren.</i></p>

<p>Well, he would certainly live it up
when he got back, Lance swore. He
would have his wedding; import
Casey from the Club to spike the
punch; and, perhaps after he'd gotten
in his required number of scout-missions,
he might even settle for a
chair-borne exec's billet, himself.</p>

<p>Exactly twenty-eight days and
twelve hours from the time of his departure
from Earth, Lance Cooper
was back home again. The <i>Cosmos
XII</i> re-materialized out of hyperspace
in the neighborhood of the Solar
System with its fuel tanks scarcely
a third depleted, but its pilot a
drained man. Lance, truthfully, not
only felt weary and torpid, but a great
deal disappointed.</p>

<p>He contacted Traffic, asked for and
got a landing trajectory. A few hours
later, he had coasted home and the
trip was over.</p>

<p>He scrambled down out of the
ship, hungry for Carolyn.</p>

<p>The base hadn't changed any in a
month, that he could see. A couple
of new floodlights put in, perhaps.
Some brass were emerging from the
control bunker. Colonel Sagen, several
others. He recognized them all.
Two were SSP's&mdash;Space Service Police.</p>

<hr />

<p>When the colonel got close, Lance
tossed off a salute and an insouciant
grin: "Well, the Prodigal made it
back home, sir. Hope that pessimistic
daughter of yours is stashed around
somewhere. Otherwise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Otherwise, what?" returned the
colonel, unsmiling.</p>

<p>"Why I'm liable to go busting
right through that fence," said Lance.
"And say, if anybody's worrying
about the <i>Cosmos XII</i>, she flew like
a dream, colonel. Matter of fact,
she&mdash;"</p>

<p>Colonel Sagen's jaws snapped together.
Wheeling, he barked at the
two SSP's: "Spacemen, arrest this officer!
Immediately!"</p>

<p>Lance couldn't believe his ears.</p>

<p>"Hey, wait a minute!" he protested.
"What have I done?"</p>

<p>Nobody answered. Not at first.</p>

<p>"Well?" Lance asked again, a little
more uneasy this time.</p>

<p>"I have no daughter, major," Hard-Head
Sagen growled, standing with
his legs braced apart and his ramrod
shoulders looking businesslike. "I
never have had."</p>

<p>The space cops sprang forward.
One drew a pistol, held it on the returned
pilot, while the other quickly
moved behind Lance and pinioned
his arms back.</p>

<p>"Is this a joke, colonel?" Lance
demanded, struggling. "If it is, I
don't appreciate it. You know you've
got a daughter, and I'm going to marry
her!"</p>

<p>The colonel's jaws clamped tight;
and he shook his head from side to
side, as if he were dealing with a person
suddenly out of his mind. Then
he acted.</p>

<p>"Put this man under close confinement,"
he ordered Lance's guards.
"Allow no visitors of any kind." The
colonel's tone was harsh and worried.
"I've got to buck this matter to HQ.
We can't have it blow up right now,
God knows."</p>

<p>The space police nudged Lance.
"All right, major. Let's go."</p>

<p>Lance's anger seethed to a boil.
Hunching his shoulders, he rammed
back against the guard holding him,
sending him tumbling. What was inside
his mind to do if he managed an
escape, he couldn't have told. He
only knew he had to get away. The
colonel had flipped.</p>

<p>And where, by the way, was Carolyn?
It seemed impossible she
could be in on it, too.</p>

<p>He stood free for a moment,
watching warily.</p>

<p>"Hold him!" shouted Colonel Sagen.
"Don't let him run loose."</p>

<p>"We got gas pills, colonel," suggested
the space cop Lance had
bowled over. The man was rising to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Use them."</p>

<p>Lance started to run. Over his
shoulder, he saw the guard reach inside
a small pocket in his webbed
pistol belt. The man gestured to the
others to duck back out of harm's way.
Then, his throwing arm reared back
and sent a pellet sailing in a high arc.
It landed at Lance's feet and burst
instantly. Yellowish gas billowed out.
Its acrid fumes penetrated Lance's
throat and nostrils. He began coughing.
Then, all the fight suddenly
ebbed from him. His knees buckled.
He was stumbling, falling. The sky
reeled.</p>

<p>And very indistinctly, from far
away, came the colonel's voice, barking:
"Put him in the brig until he
recovers. I repeat, let nobody see
him. And another thing&mdash;I declare
everything that's happened here today
classified information. If a single
word leaks out, I'll have every man-jack
among you placed in solitary and
held for court-martial."</p>

<p>Then, Lance knew nothing more.</p>

<hr />

<p>When at last he recovered consciousness
and was able to sit up in
a kind of groggy stupor, Lance found
himself, for the first time in fifteen
service-devoted years, on the inside of
a guardhouse looking out.</p>

<p>With sardonic melancholy, he recalled
times on his O.D. and O.G.
tours when he had inspected various
prison areas, peered into the cells,
and often felt mildly sorry for some
poor spaceman doing time for some
minor infraction. There had never
been very many offenders. Discipline
on space bases was not a pressing
problem: the corps was an elite
branch and intransigent candidates
were weeded out quick.</p>

<p>Well, now he was a prisoner, himself.
He, Lance Cooper, Major, Space
Service, stood behind bars. And no
matter how hard his face pressed
against those bars, he could only see
as far as the corridor extended in
either direction.</p>

<p>It wasn't far enough.</p>

<p>Nor would anybody talk to him.
He couldn't even get the time of day.</p>

<p>Not since his probation as a plebe,
had he consorted with such a bunch
of "hush-mouths." Had he no rights
as a commissioned officer and a
world citizen? He still didn't know
why he was incarcerated, or what
regulation he had broken.</p>

<p>But that wasn't his most nagging
worry.</p>

<p>What preyed on his mind most
was Carolyn.</p>

<p><i>Where was she?</i></p>

<p><i>Where? Where? WHERE?</i></p>

<p>He could have lowered his head
and pounded it to a pulp against the
wall, in his rage and frustration at
being confined. But banging his
brains out wouldn't help. Besides, he
was going to stand deeply in need of
his gray matter, if he hoped to get
out of this one.</p>

<p>At evening time, a guardhouse
trusty brought him his supper on a
tray. Also, the man tossed him half a
pack of cigarettes when Lance sought
to bum just one. But when the pilot
started pitching questions back, the
trusty looked scared and unhappy
and quickly limped away.</p>

<p>The night dragged on, as unending
seemingly as one of Luna's two-week
darkouts. Lance smoked, paced
the cell from wall to wall, occasionally
plopped down on his cot and
went over everything that had happened,
trying to find some pattern to
it.</p>

<p>But there was no pattern.</p>

<p>Next morning, he splashed up and
shaved beard away from a tired, red-eyed
face in the mirror. Then, he
waited. No one came.</p>

<p>Finally, at noon a new officer
checked in for duty at the guardhouse.
Lance recognized him as a
young ordinance captain he'd met
before. He called out to the man.
The officer, striding down the hallway,
wheeled at the sound of his
name and came back to the cell. His
eyes bugged slightly, when he saw
Lance: "Holy smoke, major! What've
they got you in for?"</p>

<p>"Search me." Lance was overjoyed
to find someone, at last, who didn't
dummy up. "I thought maybe you
might have a notion."</p>

<p>"I just came on duty. But if there's
a charge sheet lying around, I might
dig up something from it."</p>

<p>"Would you try?"</p>

<p>The captain held up two fingers
and grinned. "No sweat."</p>

<hr />

<p>Lance waited some more.</p>

<p>The captain did not come back,
however, until several hours later.
After Lance's evening meal, in fact.
His face bore a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>Lance stood at his cell door, gripping
the bars. "Well?"</p>

<p>"I checked. Seems the brass are
holding you for observation until
some headshrinker gets in from HQ.
A specialist in hyperspace medicine."</p>

<p>"Then, how come I'm not in a
regular hospital? Why the jailhouse?"</p>

<p>"Beats me, major. I can tell you
this, though. You're not the first
hype-pilot who's been dragged in
here screaming."</p>

<p>"But I wasn't screaming! I was
perfectly calm and collected, when I
climbed down out of my ship. All I
did was ask about Carolyn."</p>

<p>"About who?"</p>

<p>"Carolyn Sagen. Old Hard-Head's
daughter." Lance felt a sinking feeling.
He stopped, cocked a wary eye
at the other officer. "Don't look at me
that way, man."</p>

<p>The captain had been staring hard
at Lance. Now, he began shaking his
head back and forth, slowly and sadly.</p>

<p>"What's that supposed to mean?"
Lance asked.</p>

<p>"It means Colonel Sagen doesn't
have a daughter."</p>

<p>Lance snorted. "Don't tell me
that. I'm engaged to her."</p>

<p>"Sorry, major. I've been around the
colonel and his wife since I was a
kid. He got me the appointment to
the Academy. They've never had any
children of their own."</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;" Lance reached
through the bars and grabbed the
captain by his shirt collar, jerking
him against the bars. "It's a lie! A
conspiracy! Maybe you think I'm
nuts. But I'm not!" He commenced
pummeling the captain with his free
fist. Then he thought of something
better. He snatched the captain's gun
from his holster and leveled it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/004.png" width="600" height="494" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I'm getting out of here," Lance
announced. "Open up this door&mdash;or
take the consequences!"</p>

<p>The captain, his face ashy white,
submitted and unlocked the cell
door. Lance stepped out, got behind
the officer, and prodded him into the
cell. Tearing a sheet into strips, he
tied the man to the cot and gagged
him. It took a very short time.</p>

<p>Then, he softly padded down the
hallway. He caught the sergeant of
the guard napping in his chair. In a
moment, the sergeant, too, was
trussed up, gagged, and whisked into
a spare cell. Lance then tucked the
captain's pistol inside his shirt and
ventured outside.</p>

<p>It was a moonlit night. A patrol
jeep was parked on the drive, begging
to be commandeered. Lance hopped
in. There was something he had to
find out for himself, and only one way
to do it: Go to the place where they
kept the answers.</p>

<p>Wheeling the jeep along the military
street fast as he dared, Lance
headed for the base housing area.
Colonel Sagen's trim two-story brick
residence was where he hoped to pay
a call. He knew the route by heart.
He'd been a guest there often
enough.</p>

<p>The colonel's driveway was empty
of cars, he was happy to notice, when
he reached the house. He parked,
sprinted up to the porch, and knocked
on the door.</p>

<p>Presently, footsteps sounded inside
and the door opened a few inches.
But it was not Carolyn whom Lance
saw peeping out at him. It was another
woman, older. He recognized Mrs.
Sagen.</p>

<p>Lance was blunt. "I've got to see
Carolyn, and I haven't much time.
You'd better let me in."</p>

<p>An apprehensive, almost shocked
expression briefly flitted across the
face of Carolyn's mother. It was as if
she had never set eyes on Lance
Cooper before. Even the gold oak
leaves on his shoulders seemed to
reassure her but slightly. She kept the
door chain in place between them.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, major. I'm not sure that
I understand you."</p>

<p>"Don't malarky me, please. You
know who I am and who I want.
Carolyn, your daughter."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Sagen. It was said
in a way that revealed nothing.</p>

<p>"Look," said Lance, impatiently.
"You do have a daughter. I've dated
her. So, all right," he waved his hands,
"she's been spirited away for some
reason. I still think I've got a right to
know why."</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" said Mrs. Sagen, and her
hand flew to her face. "You must be
that scout-ship pilot who showed up
yesterday. The one who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeh, the one everybody figures for
psycho. But I'm not, Mrs. Sagen. You
know I'm not." Lance took a deep
breath. "Can I come in? I just want
some facts. After all, this crazy farce
can't go on forever."</p>

<p>The colonel's wife still looked
doubtful, but Lance Cooper had a
way of pressing a point hard when
his interests were at stake. He began
talking rapidly and convincingly.</p>

<p>He got in.</p>

<hr />

<p>The light indoors was better.
Lance's eyes squinted, as they adjusted
from the gloom of the porch. Somehow,
Mrs. Sagen didn't look quite as
he remembered. Her hair was much
darker now; he was sure of that.
Maybe she had dyed it. Yet her features
were certainly harder and bonier.
More like a replica of her husband's.
And her breath smelled alcoholic.
Could a mere month have
made that much difference?</p>

<p>The house had been refurnished
too, Lance noticed. The living-room
decor was more severe and functional.
And the pictures on the wall were
garish. Not Mrs. Sagen's type, at all.</p>

<p><i>Hey, wait a minute!</i> he told himself;
<i>speaking of pictures</i>&mdash;his glance
skipped to the far corner of the room.
A triptych of photos of Carolyn had
always been on display on the mantelpiece.
<i>They would prove that&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Lance's jaw dropped.</p>

<p>The photos had been removed.</p>

<p>"Can I get you anything?" Mrs.
Sagen inquired. A little nervously,
Lance thought. "A cup of coffee?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks. I'd rather hear about
Carolyn."</p>

<p>"Coffee won't take a minute. I was
just making some fresh in the kitchen."</p>

<p>Lance shrugged. "Well, O.K., if
you've already got it ready."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sagen's mouth managed a
fleeting smile; then she disappeared
through a swinging door. Lance sat
down in a wrought-iron chair. Finding
it not comfortable, he sprang
back to his feet and paced the floor.
There sure was something wrong
about the colonel's house. Something
very oddly wrong. But he couldn't
quite put his finger on it.</p>

<p>Suddenly, his quickened hearing
caught the faint murmur of a human
voice. Was it Carolyn? The talk
seemed to be issuing from the kitchen&mdash;where
her mother had gone.
Lance tiptoed across the room, pushed
the door slightly open.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sagen was on the phone. Her
voice was excited; she was obviously
straining to keep it at a low level.
"I'm telling you, he's here! Right in
our living room. And he insists I
know somebody named Carolyn ...
Yes, that's right. But do hurry ...
Please. He's acting much odder than
the others did."</p>

<p>Lance had eavesdropped enough.
He turned away, glided rapidly out
the front door and into the night.</p>

<p>Where should he go next? The
jeep would serve to hustle him
around the base for a while&mdash;but
eventually he would be chased down
and recaptured. And as for crashing
any of the exit gates and thus attaining
to greater freedom, he knew
they would all be barricaded and
heavily manned by now.</p>

<p>Lance was still burning over Mrs.
Sagen's double-cross. Did he want
coffee? she had asked. <i>Coffee!</i> his
mind repeated, disgusted. What he
needed was something stronger. A
good stiff drink.</p>

<p>That was it! The Officers Club.
Casey would be on duty at this hour.
Lance would ask him to mix him a
double for old times' sake. Then, he'd
meekly surrender and quietly go
crazy in his cell, until the headshrinker
came and confirmed it for real.</p>

<hr />

<p>The pilot got back in the jeep
and drove on. When he reached the
Club, he wheeled the vehicle around
to a rear entrance where bushes made
the grounds shadier. Parking, he got
out, strolled into the building as
sneakily as if he'd been an inspector-general
paying a surprise call from
out of Space Service Headquarters.</p>

<p>Few officers lounged about. Most
were at tables and engrossed in their
own imbibing. Lance strode up to
the bar, perched himself on a high
stool. Casey, whose hair was red as a
Martian desert, was rinsing glasses.
He stopped at his task and came
over, wiping the counter with a wet
towel. "What'll it be, major?"</p>

<p>"One of your Specials, Casey, my
friend."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon?"</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;one of your Casey
Specials. Where you start off with
half a glass of Irish whisky, add a
dash or two of absinthe, a drop of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't stock no absinthe, major."
Casey's freckled face was abruptly
hostile. "You know that. It's against
regulations."</p>

<p>Lance fought down a tremor. Everybody
was in on it. Everybody. He
compromised for a minute: "Give me
a slug of Teacher's on the rocks, then."</p>

<p>Casey measured out the drink for
him.</p>

<p>Lance downed it. His hand gripped
the edge of the bar. "Casey, do you
know me?"</p>

<p>He watched Casey study him. The
thick reddish eyebrows knit. "It's a
pretty big base, major. Lots of faces.
Sometimes, I kind of forget the
names."</p>

<p>Lance's blood pressure gave a
spurt. "I'm Major Lance Cooper!
Hell, you've rung up my chits often
enough!"</p>

<p>And his mind added: <i>How could
you forget?</i></p>

<p>"Major." Casey's eyes narrowed,
while the uneasy suspicion in them
grew. "We don't have no chit system
at this club."</p>

<p>Lance's head felt like it would explode.
He could take no more.</p>

<p>"You're lying!" he shouted. His
big hands reached over the mahogany
counter and shook the bartender
like a squawk-box that had refused
to function properly. "Tell me you're
lying in your teeth. If you don't, I'll
push them down your throat&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly, Lance sensed people behind
him. A firm hand clamped down
heavily on his shoulder.</p>

<p>The pilot stretched his neck
around. What now? His hands did
not relax their murderous grip on his
victim.</p>

<p>The arresting party had entered
the club quietly. Now, they were
ganged up around him: Colonel Sagen,
his two aides, a fourth man
Lance recognized as Major Carmody,
the base legal officer&mdash;and a fifth
man too, who wore the insignia of
the Space Surgeon-General's Department.
A psychiatrist.</p>

<p>"Better come peacefully, major,"
rasped Colonel Sagen. "You've been
'cleared' for an explanation&mdash;and if
you're smart, you'll listen to the spiel
and play ball."</p>

<p>The way it was said made Lance
feel he could trust the Old Man for
that long. Anyhow, what choice did
he have?</p>

<p>"It's about time," Lance sighed. He
set Casey down, to the latter's greatly
exhaled relief. "Only how come all
the suspense?"</p>

<p>"It was very necessary," broke in
Major Carmody.</p>

<p>"Was it? Well, you had me about
to crack&mdash;if that was your object.
Now then, would any of you mind
easing my worries about Carolyn.
She's O.K., isn't she?"</p>

<p>His glance shifted from one to the
other.</p>

<p>"Isn't she?"</p>

<p>Nobody would reply&mdash;neither
Colonel Sagen, nor any of the officers
bunched-up around him.</p>

<p>Sweat suddenly broke out on
Lance's brow. The chilly feeling went
through him that if and when an answer
was provided him, he wasn't
particularly going to like it.</p>

<p>Not in the slightest.</p>

<hr />

<p>Shortly afterwards, Lance was driven
across the base by his captors and
escorted into his commanding officer's
private office. The two aides
were dismissed, but the psychiatrist-officer,
who also wore eagles on his
shoulders, and Major Carmody remained.</p>

<p>Colonel Sagen seated himself behind
his desk.</p>

<p>"Major," he began, clearing his
throat, "you imagine me to have a
daughter. You're positive of it. You
even visualize her so well, that you
remember something about how you
were going to marry her."</p>

<p>"You're not going to talk me out
of anything on that score," Lance
shot back.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, we don't intend to. Colonel
Nordsen, here," Sagen indicated
the psychiatrist, "has flown in from
HQ to chat with you. He can explain
the technical aspects of the phenomenon
that has thrown you better than
I can. I'd advise you to listen to him.
He's just what you need."</p>

<p>"Just what I need? What else do
you intend to do? Hypnotize me, so
you can erase all my past?"</p>

<p>The colonel scowled. "Look here,
major. You co-operate and learn to
keep your mouth shut, we may be
able to restore you to duty. But if
not ... well, what happens then
will be entirely up to Nordsen. It
could mean a padded cell. The development
of hyperspace exploration
has to go on, whatever happens to
you."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing to your
face, colonel," Lance replied, hotly.
"I'm not off my rocker."</p>

<p>"No one has maintained you
were," broke in Colonel Nordsen.
"But Colonel Sagen had to throw a
curtain around you fast."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Neither officer answered.</p>

<p>Finally, Colonel Sagen said, "I
think you'd better continue with him,
Colonel Nordsen."</p>

<p>Nordsen was a youthful-looking
man for his rank, yet prematurely
balding. He wore thick-shelled
glasses.</p>

<p>"Major Cooper," Nordsen began,
"let's go back to when you put the
<i>Cosmos XII</i> through its first jump
through hyperspace. How well do
you recall your experience?"</p>

<p>"I'll never forget it. You Earthbound
kiwis should try it sometime."</p>

<p>"Did you experience a feeling ...
perhaps, rather uncanny ... that
the whole thing had happened to
you before? What psychologists call
the sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Perhaps some other type of phenomenon
was manifested? A feeling
you'd been split in half, maybe."</p>

<p>"That did happen."</p>

<p>"Describe it."</p>

<p>"It was more than just being split
in half. I felt like I was suddenly
hundreds of selves. I could see other
replicas of 'me' all around."</p>

<p>Nordsen nodded, thoughtfully.
"That was what we call the 'Infinite
Fission' syndrome. All those other
'you's' were personality matrices of
yourself in alternate worlds. Did you
notice anything else?"</p>

<p>Lance nodded, grudgingly.</p>

<hr />

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Look, colonel. If I answer your
questions, will you answer mine?"</p>

<p>"Any reasonable ones, yes. That's
what we're here for."</p>

<p>"Well, there was the disturbing
thing about the <i>Cosmos XII</i>, itself. I
saw images of the ship riding along
beside me, out there in the hype.
Where nothing material could possibly
exist. Where not even light could
reflect back, or any other wave propagation."
Lance shook his head, recalling
the experience. "What could
have caused a hallucination like
that?"</p>

<p>"It was no hallucination, Lance. It
was real and has happened before.
We can rest you easy on that point."</p>

<p>Colonel Nordsen removed tobacco
from a pouch, stuffed his pipe, lit up.
Bluish smoke formed a halo about
him.</p>

<p>"Lance, the Space Service has been
sending ships through hyperspace for
nearly two years now. Only recently
did anybody notice something was
seriously wrong with the pilots who
came back. Up until then ... oh, a
pilot might act a little queer for a
day or two. But who wouldn't, cooped
up alone in a steel projectile for four
weeks? We thought very little of it."</p>

<p>"Uh huh," was Lance Cooper's only
comment.</p>

<p>Nordsen transferred his pipe to
his hand. "But eventually, even the
Space Service gets around to putting
two and two together on the slipstick.
The incidents kept piling up. A pilot
comes back from Epsilon Eridani, for
example, and insists on giving everybody
left-handed salutes. Another
has taken a scout ship to 61 Cygni.
He insists at the Officers Club that
Colonel Sagen here has a nickname
of 'Old Hard-Head'. Nobody else on
the base is aware of any such thing.
Then, still another pilot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" Lance interrupted.
"Hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Hasn't what? I don't follow you."</p>

<p>"Colonel Sagen. Hasn't he got that
nickname? I mean, it was a term of
respect and liking, of course. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Nordsen.</p>

<p>"No?" Lance echoed, disbelieving.
"Since when?"</p>

<p>"Not since <i>ever</i>, major. Not on
this particular track."</p>

<p>"Colonel Nordsen, you're losing
me."</p>

<p>"Patience, please. I was about to
tell you that still another pilot lands
on our base, and he wears a blue tie.
Claims the Space Service has always
worn blue ties."</p>

<p>"I take it back," said Lance. "I'm
a pilot and all pilots are slowly going
nuts." Then, it occurred to him to
evince more interest or they might
ship him back to the brig sooner
than expected. "A blue tie, huh?"</p>

<p>"And blue suede chukkas, to
match," Colonel Sagen's hoarse voice
broke in. "Most unmilitary-looking
uniform I ever saw on a space officer."</p>

<p>Colonel Nordsen, the psychiatrist,
set his pipe aside. "Gradually, we began
building up a file of such weird
discrepancies. Another pilot landed
wearing a handle-bar mustache. He
couldn't possibly have grown so
much lip-hair in a month. Yet, the
man claimed he'd sported the mustache
for years; and that every officer
in his squadron was decked out with
one, too."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Tell me just one thing," Lance
pleaded. His nerves were gradually
getting more on edge. "What has all
this got to do with Carolyn Sagen?
Why is she being kept from me?"</p>

<p>Nordsen's eyebrows met, evincing
a little displeasure. "Don't you get
the drift, major? I've been trying to
accomplish two things at the same
time. Cushion a shock for you&mdash;and
explain why what has happened has
happened. There is no Carolyn Sagen.
The colonel and his wife have
always been childless."</p>

<p>Lance got belligerent. "Say that
again!"</p>

<p>"There is no Carolyn Sagen here."</p>

<p>"What d'you mean, when you say
'here'?"</p>

<p>Nordsen took off his shell-rimmed
glasses, wiped them, restored them
to his boyish face. "I would advise
you to brace yourself. By 'here,' I
mean on this particular time-track."</p>

<p>Lance stared at him.</p>

<p>"Doesn't the word have any significance
for you?" Nordsen asked.</p>

<p>"Time-track? Sure, I've heard of
the concept before. It's a theory that
parallel worlds branch off when ...
hey!" Lance's tone rose to a shout.
"You're not trying to imply that ...
that I'm on a diff&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That's right. We're trying to tell
you that you have obviously landed
in another time-track. One that is
parallel to&mdash;but just a slight bit different
from the one you formerly
knew. To you, we seem to be the
same officers as in that world; but of
course, we're not. It isn't the same
universe. Hyperspace is tricky stuff,
as our men are finding out. You've
just got bounced around by one of the
trickiest things connected with it."</p>

<p>Lance groaned. "Now, I'm told!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. It's nothing new, only
the information is classified top-secret
in our world; and evidently in
yours, too. It has to be withheld from
hype-trainees, otherwise they might
deliberately flunk their course. We're
running pilot classes here on our
track, too. We have to keep them
filled."</p>

<p>Lance was stunned. He hardly
knew what he should say or do next.</p>

<p>Finally, he put forth a faltering
question: "Is there any way I can get
back to Home Base? <i>My</i> home base?"</p>

<p>All three officers in the room shook
their heads in unison.</p>

<p>"You might as well look for a pebble
in the beach," said Nordsen. He
elucidated: "As a matter of fact, this
<i>is</i> Home Base for you. The differences
between one track and another are
not usually too great; the resemblances
are many. Sometimes even,
the returned pilot accommodates himself
to the new time-track without
suspecting in the slightest what's
happened to him."</p>

<p>"And in those cases, you seldom
bother to enlighten him, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Naturally not. Security frowns on
it."</p>

<p>"But in my case, you couldn't cover
up."</p>

<p>"Your case manifests a much more
serious slippage. Your path, evidently,
warped to a track several million
or billion worlds further over
than anybody from your world had
previously experienced. Consequently,
your luck has really been unfortunate.
You've materialized out of
hyperspace into a universe where
someone you apparently knew quite
closely simply was never born."</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/005.png" width="320" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"But Carolyn did exist before ...
where I was? I'm not dreaming."</p>

<p>"No. Both our worlds are equally
real."</p>

<hr />

<p>Lance, though he felt the truth
slowly and inexorably sink in, still
could not quite grasp all its implications.
He turned his numbed face to
the other two officers in the room.
Colonel Sagen and Major Carmody
inclined their heads.</p>

<p>For one despairing moment, Lance
felt almost like hurling himself
through the window. Then, he
straightened up. His mouth compressed
into a thin line. "If I must
face the facts, I must. But," his tone
edged off into irony, "it sure isn't
easy. You'll have to give me time."</p>

<p>Colonel Nordsen stood up, held
out his hand. "I'm sorry, major, believe
me. This is a hard blow to take
and I wouldn't care to be on the receiving
end, myself. But you'll adjust.
If you like, I'll recommend you
for convalescent leave. You understand,
of course," the psychiatrist
went on, "that we expect you to keep
tight-lipped. Our hype-classes are
still too small. We need a lot of
sharp men, and they have to be
volunteers. Right, Colonel Sagen?"</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>Lance dropped the proffered hand.
"I get it. Let the word get around
how hyperspace messes you up, all
your bright young jets will bug out
on it. That's your main worry, isn't
it? Not what happens to me."</p>

<p>"Frankly, yes," Nordsen acknowledged,
without blinking. "But the
Space Service is also concerned about
individuals. Don't worry now, major.
We'll look after you."</p>

<p>"Don't bother!" An uncontrolled
bitterness crept into Lance's reply.
"Far as I'm concerned, the Space
Service can go to hell. What reason
have I got to stay in it? You've
conned me out of all that meant anything
in my life."</p>

<p>Nobody said a word.</p>

<p>Lance rose to his feet, unsteadily.
His sardonic glance swept over
them. "I suppose it's back to the
guardhouse for me now, huh? Well,
I won't be sorry to go. I'll find better
company. And I refuse your bribe of
special leave-time."</p>

<p>Colonel Nordsen seemed unaffected.
"You're making a mistake,"
he said, calmly.</p>

<p>"Am I?"</p>

<p>"Major, we're offering you a chance
to get adjusted and assimilated. Take
it or leave it. We can hold you in
the brig until you see reason. But
you're a good man. We need you."</p>

<p>"For what? More flights through
that hyperspace muck?"</p>

<p>"If you can pass our mental stability
tests, yes."</p>

<p>"And if not?"</p>

<p>"You'll be grounded."</p>

<p>Lance made a sudden decision.</p>

<p>"I want to go up right now."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<hr />

<p>"You heard me. I want to go up in
the <i>Cosmos XII</i> right now, tests or
no tests. Ground me&mdash;and I'll never
have a chance again. Don't you think
I'm hep to that?"</p>

<p>"We'll see that you're not grounded,"
broke in Colonel Sagen, from
behind his desk.</p>

<p>But Lance didn't believe him.</p>

<p>"Don't try to kid me, colonel," he
snapped out. "You write me out
flight orders for the <i>Cosmos XII</i>, or
I'll blab everything I know. You
can't hang me, you can't tear my
tongue out&mdash;and I know I'll bust
out of your guardhouse one way or
another! You'll see! And then, how
will you fill up your precious training
classes? Then, how will you get
new chumps to pilot your ships to the
stars? The stars! Ha, ha! That's the
biggest joke of all!"</p>

<p>Colonel Sagen began to splutter.
Lance, watching him carefully, decided
there wasn't much resemblance
between the old boy and the fine Colonel
Sagen he'd known in his own
world. Maybe it'd been having the
softening influence of normal family
life and a growing daughter that had
made old Hard-Head human.</p>

<p>"You'll never get away with this,"
Sagen warned. "We're three against
one."</p>

<p>"Won't I?" Lance's hand darted inside
his shirt. "Maybe this'll equalize
us." He brought out the pistol he'd
taken off the captain in the guardhouse.
Sagen, Nordsen, and Carmody
backed off from it.</p>

<p>"The <i>Cosmos XII</i> is still two-thirds
fueled," Lance said. "And
well-stocked on provisions. Besides,
I'm a light eater in hyperspace&mdash;as
who isn't? I intend to take that ship
out again, and you're going to help
me, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Lance flicked off the safety and
waved the gun back and forth, to
demonstrate what he meant.</p>

<hr />

<p>It worked.</p>

<p>Lance got his ship, using Colonel
Sagen as both shield and go-between
after he had first tied up the other
two officers in a closet. He kept a
close watch, of course, for the SSP's
and their gas pellets; but apparently
an alarm was not raised soon enough
for the base police to hurl into action.</p>

<p>After having the colonel authorize
a space clearance for him by contacting
Traffic directly over the
ship's mike, Lance finally released
him.</p>

<p>The colonel scooted down the ladder.
Lance gave him time to clear the
pad, but little more; then he went to
work pushing buttons on the manual
desk. The <i>Cosmos XII</i> blasted loose
from her moorings and soared aloft
into space.</p>

<p>At five thousand miles above
Earth's surface, Lance re-checked his
tapes. Groombridge 34 was the only
possible destination the autopilot
could take him to. Somehow, he didn't
mind taking one more look at the
double-star system. He cut into hyperspace
as quickly as he dared; then
sat back and relaxed. That is, as much
as any man could in hype.</p>

<p>When he reached Groombridge
34, all Lance did was pop out into
normal space long enough to assure
himself he had reached the proper
checkpoint for turning back. The
tapes were in good order, and there
had been no hitches. Grunting, he
threw in the switch-over and once
more found himself plowing through
hyperspace. Only this time, he was
homeward bound.</p>

<p>If he were lucky, just real lucky, he
told himself, there might be a Carolyn
Sagen alive and waiting for him
in whatever time-track he wound up
in this time.</p>

<p>At last, he materialized again in
the Solar System. Or <i>some</i> Solar System,
anyhow. As far as he could tell,
all the planets looked unchanged. It
was just four weeks to the day, since
his escape from World Two. This
would be World Three. He had been
gone eight weeks and two days from
World One.</p>

<p>Lance cut the ecliptic at a different
angle than before, and Terra was farther
along in her journey around Sol.
He needed a new landing trajectory.
His eye swept his panel, to see if
anything had been preset. There was
no green flashing on the deck, where
there should have been green.</p>

<p>Oh, well. There could have been
cruisers waiting in space, too, to pot
him with ship-to-ship missiles. He'd
taken one chance, he could take another.</p>

<p>Lance opened a switch and called
Base Traffic's frequency. "This is the
<i>Cosmos XII</i>, Major Lance Cooper piloting.
Just broke out of hype. Can
you read me?"</p>

<p>He repeated the message for several
minutes.</p>

<p>Finally, he got an answer. A startled
voice whipped back at him
through crackling static: "<i>Cosmos
XII</i>, this is Traffic. Who did you say
you were up there?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Lance hardly knew whether he felt
more like laughing or crying. He was
fairly close to home, anyhow. They
did have space traffic here. And being
pretty much of an optimist, he also
decided that it was a time-track where
he had been known. Only being so
long overdue, he had probably been
given up for lost.</p>

<p>On this premise, he could visualize
all the consternation and excitement
now in progress downstairs; the
personnel were likely falling all over
each other in the stampede to pass
the word around.</p>

<p>"I'm Major Lance Cooper," he announced
over the mike.</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"Repeat that, please."</p>

<p>"This is Lance Cooper, Major,
Space Service. I'm up here in the
<i>Cosmos XII</i>."</p>

<p>"B-b-but you can't be."</p>

<p>"Who says I can't. Say, what's the
matter with you monkeys? I want to
come in."</p>

<p>Another voice took over on the
channel. "The lieutenant's right. You
actually do sound like Cooper, whoever
you are!"</p>

<p>Lance laughed openly. "I've lived
with him all my life, why shouldn't I?
You think I'm a ghost?"</p>

<p>"Well ... no. We know you're
real. We're getting a blip from you.
Only thing is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's talk about it when I get
down," Lance interrupted. "I need a
program fast. Get those G.S. computers
working and read me an orbit."</p>

<p>"W-will do."</p>

<p>"And one more thing: Is Colonel
Sagen around?"</p>

<p>"Not today, major. He had to fly
to Luna."</p>

<p>"How about his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p><i>Oh, no!</i> Lance felt his heart almost
stop. Had the big try been for nothing?
He chanced a repeat.</p>

<p>"His daughter. Carolyn Sagen."</p>

<p>This time, he got results.</p>

<p>"Oh! You mean Hard-Head's
daughter. The one who ... say,
wasn't she all set to marry you?"</p>

<p>"You bet your last commendation
ribbon she was. And she's going to!
Hey!" Lance shouted. "Anything
wrong with her? She's not sick or&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voice of the first operator at
Traffic came back on. "The captain
had to take off. No sir, major. She's
not sick. We just don't know how
she's gonna take this, is all."</p>

<p>"With bells on, Junior. Wedding
bells! Get her out to meet me when
I land, will you? And snap it up on
that trajectory."</p>

<p>Again, the traffic crackled in
Lance's ear. There seemed to be a
great deal of excitement going on
down there. And then the great night
rim of Earth swung under him, blocking
out further radio communication.</p>

<p>Presently, a relayed beam from
Luna came in. The Luna spaceport
read him a series of figures to punch
into his autopilot. The new orbit
would edge him in close enough to
Terra, that he could pick up an assist
from the G.A. system of his home
base.</p>

<p>Lance rubbed his hands together in
his joy. He was cooking on all burners,
now. At last.</p>

<hr />

<p>Six hours later, the <i>Cosmos XII</i>
settled down in her landing cradle.
Major Lance Cooper kicked open the
air-lock door and began climbing
down to solid ground.</p>

<p>It was just barely twilight. Ordinarily,
there would have been long purplish
shadows at the far ends of the
field; but now the entire space base
was flooded with lights. Were the
beacons sweeping back and forth just
to welcome him? It hardly seemed
possible. Yet, the apron itself, was
swarming with people. Here they
came now! A whole mob racing towards
him, and the noise of their
swelling shouts preceded them, rolling
forward like the breakers upon a
shore.</p>

<p><i>Oh, oh! What was that in the far
corner of the field?</i> A big pile of
crumpled metal, already rusted and
ready for the bulldozers. Some poor
devil had crashed his hype-ship. Lance
wondered vaguely which of his buddies
it had been. Then he shut it out
of his mind.</p>

<p>A jeep swung out ahead of the advancing
crowd and came speeding
down the concrete. Brakes squealed;
rubber tires bit in hard, and the vehicle
plunged to a halt near him. Lance
recognized Major Carmody in the
driver's seat. Or another Major Carmody.
What difference did it make?
None, now that he was able to identify
so very well the other figure in
the jeep&mdash;a slight blond figure in
a trench coat seated next to Carmody.</p>

<p>Carolyn!</p>

<p>He saw her get out. He saw her
commence walking towards him. But
too slowly, he thought. And he was
too paralyzed to move.</p>

<p>"Lance?" she called to him. "Is it
you? Is it really you, darling?"</p>

<p>The girl's step almost faltered. Major
Carmody's hand reached out,
steadied her.</p>

<p>Something was wrong again. But
what? He could not guess.</p>

<p>Lance came out of his paralysis. He
began running towards her.</p>

<p>And in a moment, they were in
each other's arms without caring why
or how: Lance Cooper and the girl he
loved. Kissing, hugging, unable to
believe for a moment in each other's
reality.</p>

<p>Then, Carolyn had to have breath
and she drew apart for a moment.
Then, she kissed him again. And
Lance, for the first time, listened and
made sense out of the welter of hysterical
sobbing words that were pouring
forth:</p>

<p>"Darling, darling, darling Lance!
I cried so much, and now it's all over.
I don't care if you're not real. I love
you, I love you! I don't care if you are
somebody from another time-track
like Major Carmody says! You're my
Lance and you belong to me. It's you
I love and want now; no matter how
shameless I sound!... Yes, darling,
it's you I want, not that poor
broken thing we buried two months
ago. Not the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lance's feeling of impending horror
was great, but not so great that he
shrank from the question that now
rose and beat and beat at his brain.
The overwhelming question that had
to be asked.</p>

<p>"Carolyn!" He held her so tight he
thought for a moment he'd cracked
her ribs. His half-shook gaze penetrated
her retreating eyes, forcing her
to meet him.</p>

<p>"Carolyn! What do you mean&mdash;it's
<i>me</i> you want now, not that poor
broken thing you buried? Tell me.
TELL ME!"</p>

<p>"Don't you know, darling Lance?
When you took off that night eight
weeks ago, that night I kissed you
good-by, your ship ... oh don't you
comprehend?... Your ship, it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me, Carolyn!"</p>

<p>"Your ship, Lance, that's it over
there&mdash;the wreckage of it! The
<i>Cosmos XII</i> crashed on take-off that
night, Lance. You were killed out-right.
We buried you two days later."</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
